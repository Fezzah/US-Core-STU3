Typically, DocumentReference resources are used with document indexing systems, such as [IHE XDS]. However, document references may also may be created "on-the-fly" in response to a Document Query request.  In other words there MAY NOT be pre-existing indes of references to a patient's documents at the FHIR endpoint. This results in an empty bundle being returned when searching using a normal FHIR Query.  Therefore, the [$docref operation] has been defined to both create and fetch patient DocumentReference Resources.


The following search criteria describe fetching pre-indexed documents and those created "on-the-fly".


**Searching pre-indexed documents:**

*Clients*

A client has connected to a server and fetched references to documents for a patient using `GET [base]/DocumentReference?patient=[id]`

*Servers*


A server is capable of returning at references to documents for a patient using:`GET [base]/DocumentReference?patient=[id]`

 A server **SHOULD** be capable of connecting to a server and fetching references to documents for a patient searched by type and/or date using:`GET [base]/DocumentReference?patient=[id]{&type=[type]}{&period=[date]}`

- A server has rejected any unauthorized requests by returning an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response code.

*Clients*

A client has connected to a server and fetches document references for a patient:
 - `GET [base]/DocumentReference/$docref?patient=[id]`

A client **SHOULD** be capable of connecting to a server and fetching references for a patient searched by type and/or date using:

 }`


*Servers*

 A server is capable of returning at at least the most recent CCD document references and **MAY** provide most recent references to other document for a patient using:`GET [base]/DocumentReference/$docref?patient=[id]`


 A server **SHOULD** be capable of returning references to CCD documents and **MAY** provide references to other document types for a patient searched by type and/or date using:`GET [base]/DocumentReference/$docref?patient=[id]{&type=[type]}{&period=[date]
  }`
