The federal standards do not conceptually define race, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for racial classification. Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification.

Usage Notes: This means the actual value is not known.  If the only thing that is unknown is how to properly express the value in the necessary constraints (value set, datatype, etc.), then the OTH or UNC flavor should be used.  No properties should be included for a datatype with this property unless:                                                      Those properties themselves directly translate to a semantic of &quot;unknown&quot;.  (E.g. a local code sent as a translation that conveys 'unknown')                            Those properties further qualify the nature of what is unknown.  (E.g. specifying a use code of &quot;H&quot; and a URL prefix of &quot;tel:&quot; to convey that it is the home phone number that is unknown.)</td></tr><tr><td>ASKU</td><td>Asked but no answer</td><td>Information was sought but not found (e.g., patient was asked but didn't know)</td></tr></table></li></ul></div>"},"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/daf/ValueSet/daf-race","identifier":[{"system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986","value":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.2.575"}],"version":"1.6.0","name":"OMB Race Categories","status":"active","experimental":true,"publisher":"DAF Project","contact":[{"telecom":[{"system":"other","value":"http://hl7.org/fhir"}]},{"telecom":[{"system":"other","value":"http://wiki.siframework.org/Data+Access+Framework+Homepage"}]}],"date":"2016-05-25T16:59:08+10:00","description":"In the United States, federal standards for classifying data on race determine the categories used by federal agencies and exert a strong influence on categorization by state and local agencies and private sector organizations.
